Pending Issues:

- Do data checking;
- ***security***, ecryption and much more;
- Text verification code to provided Mobile no. to verify entry;
- polling backend functionality;
- Mapbox acccount may not satisfy the load, need to upgrade / general load testing;
- Writings for the umbrella and the 'info'

Optional:
- Best if poll results could be visualized immediately after vote, via d3.js etc.
- interactivity with map i.e. as people change votes the polygons on the map changes
